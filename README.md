# QuantLib Demo
I recently came across the ghosts from my childhood and realised they were no ghosts but actually very much full of live and full of questions. When you haven't seen someone for 10, 20 or 30 years, what do you ask first? 

* Do you have a family? kids?
* What do you do in life?

The first question is easy, yes I have 3 fantastic kids, Ana Paola 19, Sebastian 16 and Nicolas 11. As you can guess from the names, the mum is latina. The second question is more problematic! sometime I say that I work in IT for a bank, sometime I say I work in quantitative finance and I am specialised in risk!!!??? the next question is usually, yes but what you do exactly? I have decided to write this blog to explain, and eventually to explain to my ex-colleagues in physics what finance is all about. If things go well, I secretly hope to help quantitative finance students to avoid repeating my mistakes.
